    <title>Neural Approaches to Conversational AI</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="What’s-new"><a href="#What’s-new" class="headerlink" title="What’s new?"></a>What’s new?</h3><ol>
<li><strong>We group conversational systems into three categories: (1) question answering agents, (2) task-oriented dialogue agents, and (3)chatbots, with a unified view of optimal decision making</strong></li>
<li><strong>Draw connections between neural approaches to traditional ones</strong></li>
<li><strong>Present approaches to training dialogue agents using both supervised and reinforcement(++) learning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Progress and challenges both in research community and industry.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><ul>
<li><p>Why we get promising results?</p>
<ol>
<li>large amounts of data available for training.</li>
<li>breakthroughs in deep learning and reinforcement learning.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>A typical task-oriented dialogue agent is composed of four modules:<br>  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1587927050/1111_zxlmue.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>NLU(Understanding): identify user intents, extract associate info.</li>
<li>State Tracker: capture all essential info, track the dialogue state.</li>
<li>Dialogue Policy: select the next action based on the current state.</li>
<li>NLG(Generation): convert agent actions to natural language responses.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>But recent trend: Develope fully data-driven systems by unifying these modules using a deep neural network that maps the user input to the agent output DIRECTLY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Difference in modular or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task-oriented bots:<ul>
<li>access to an external database</li>
<li>using a modular system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social chatbots:<ul>
<li>To be AI companions to humans with an emotional connection</li>
<li>mimic human conversation by training DNN-based response generation models on large amounts of human-human conversational data.</li>
<li>non-modular system</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dialogue can be formulated as a decision making process.</p>
<ul>
<li>hierarchy<ul>
<li>top level: selects what agent be active</li>
<li>low level: chooses primitive actions to complete the subtask</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hierachical decision making processes can be cast in options over Markov Decision Processes(Sutton et al)<ul>
<li>This view has already been applied to some large-scale open-domain dialogue systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we view each option as an action, both top and low level processes can be natually captured by the reinforcement learning framework.<ul>
<li>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</li>
<li>The goal of dialogue learning is to find optimal policies to maximize expected rewards.</li>
<li>rewards functions:<br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1587945852/222_ctrk2x.png" alt=""></li>
<li><strong>controdictary rewards CPS for xiaoice?</strong><ul>
<li>Although incorporating many task-oriented and QA skills can reduce CPS in the short term since these skills help users accomplish tasks more efficiently by minimizing CPS, these new skills establish XiaoIce as an efficient and trustworthy personal assistant, thus strengthening the emotional bond with human users in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>limit of RL view:<ul>
<li>applying RL requires training the agents by interacting with real users, which can be expensive in many domains.</li>
<li>solution<ul>
<li>hybrid approach: combines the strengths of different ML methods.</li>
<li>For example, we might use imitation and/or supervised learning methods (if there is a large amount of human-human conversational corpus) to obtain a reasonably good agent before applying RL to continue improving it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic V.S Neural approaches<br>  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1587950076/333_jcwtrl.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>neural approaches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>can be trained in an end-to-end fasion</strong></li>
<li><strong>robust to paraphrase alternations(detecting and generating paraphrases)</strong></li>
<li><strong>weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>symbolic approaches</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sensitive to paraphrase alternations</strong></li>
<li><strong>more interpretable and efficient in execution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>difficult to train</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic approaches</p>
<ul>
<li>dominated for decades</li>
<li>resolve natural language ambiguity at different levels by mapping (or generating) a natural language sentence to (or from) a series of human-defined, unambiguous, symbolic representations, such as Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, context free grammar, first-order predicate calculus.</li>
<li>now: have been adapted as a rich source of engineered features to be fed into a variety of machine learning models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>neural approaches</p>
<ul>
<li>do not rely on any human-defined symbolic representations</li>
<li>learn in a task- specific neural space where task-specific knowledge is implicitly represented as semantic concepts using low-dimensional continuous vectors.</li>
<li>steps:<ol>
<li>encoding symbolic user input and knowledge into their neural sematic representations( represent as vectors)</li>
<li>reasoning: to generate a system response based on input and system state.</li>
<li>decoding</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the above three steps are stacked into a deep neural network trained in an end-to-end fastionl via back propagation.<ul>
<li>back propagation:<ul>
<li>a widely used algorithm in training feedforward neural networks for supervised learning. </li>
<li>In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually.</li>
<li>The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this is an example of dynamic programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>end-to-end causes: the focus has shifted to carefully tailoring the increasingly complex architecture of neural networks to the end application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>review: Although neural approaches have already been widely adopted in many AI tasks, including image processing, speech recognition and machine translation (e.g., Goodfellow et al., 2016), their impact on conversational AI has come somewhat more slowly.</li>
<li>addition merits: neural approaches provide a consistent representation for many modalities, capturing linguistic and non-linguistic (e.g., image and video (Mostafazadeh et al., 2017)) features in the same modeling framework.</li>
</ul>

    <title>[BASIC]Word Embedding</title>
    <url>/2020/04/30/BASIC-Word-Embedding/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Word-Embedding-layers"><a href="#Word-Embedding-layers" class="headerlink" title="Word Embedding layers"></a>Word Embedding layers</h1><h2 id="Define-word-embedding"><a href="#Define-word-embedding" class="headerlink" title="Define word embedding"></a>Define word embedding</h2><p>Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.</p>
<p>Word embeddings are in fact a class of techniques where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. Each word is mapped to one vector and the vector values are learned in a way that resembles a neural network, <strong>based on the usage of the words.</strong></p>
<p>Each word is represented as a <strong>one hot</strong> vector, whose dimensionality <em>n</em> is the size of a pre-defined voca<br>bulary. The vocabulary is often too large. Word embedding model is to map each one-hot vector to a m-dimensional real-valued vector. m 《 n. The number of features is much smaller than the size of the vocabulary.</p>
<h3 id="one-hot"><a href="#one-hot" class="headerlink" title="one-hot"></a>one-hot</h3><p>EX1: Suppose you have ‘flower’ feature which can take values ‘daffodil’, ‘lily’, and ‘rose’. One hot encoding converts ‘flower’ feature to three features, ‘is_daffodil’, ‘is_lily’, and ‘is_rose’ which all are binary.</p>
<p>EX2: <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1588178728/one-hot_qa7mmr.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Word embeddng is one of the key breakthroughs of DL on challenging NLP.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>low-dimensinal vector</strong>: the majority of neural network toolkits do not play well with very high-dimensional, sparse vectors</li>
<li><strong>dense vector</strong>:  it is worthwhile to provide a representation that is able to capture these similarities on features.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Word-embedding-algorithms"><a href="#Word-embedding-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Word embedding algorithms"></a>Word embedding algorithms</h2><p><strong>Word embedding methods are learning process.</strong></p>
<p>They learn a <em>real-valued vector representation</em> for a predefined fixed sized vocabulary <em>from a corpus of text</em>.</p>
<p>Two types of learning process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joint with neural network model on some task.</li>
<li>Unsupervised process, using document statistics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Three ways to learn a word embedding:</p>
<p><strong>1.Embedding layer</strong></p>
<p>It’s a word embedding, which is learned jointly with a <em>neural network model</em> on a <em>specific</em> natural language processing task(ex: language modeling or document classification).</p>
<p>It’s <em>used</em> on the front end of a neural network and is fit in a supervised way using a Backpropagation algorithm.</p>
<p>It requires that document text be cleaned and prepared such that each word is one-hot encoded.</p>
<ul>
<li>disadvantage: It requires a lot of training data and can be slow</li>
<li>advantage: It will learn an embedding both targeted to the <em>specific text data</em> and the <em>NLP task</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Word2Vec</strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>effient</strong>, good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities, learns a <em>standalone</em> word embedding from a text corpus.</p>
<pre><code>low space and time complexity
more dimensions
much larger corpora of text </code></pre><p><strong>Ex: King - man + woman = Queen.</strong></p>
<p>– Word2Vec involved analysis of the learned vectors and the exploration of vector math on the representations of words. </p>
<p><em>Two different models</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CBOW(continuous Bag-of-Words) model</p>
<p>  CBOW learns the embedding by predicting the current word based on its context.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continuous Skip-Gram Model</p>
<p>  It learns by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1588197753/word2vec_j3hnqr.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Size of sliding winodw</strong><br>The context is defined by a window of neighboring words. This window is a configurable parameter of the model.</p>
<p>Large windows tend to produce more topical similarities, while smaller windows tend to produce more functional and syntactic similarities.</p>
<p><strong>3.GloVe: The Global Vectors for Word Representation</strong></p>
<p>It is an extension to the word2vec method for efficiently learning word vectors. GloVe is an approach to marry both the <em>global statistics of matrix factorization techniques</em> like LSA with the <em>local context-based learning</em> in word2vec.</p>
<ul>
<li>LSA(latent semantic analysis): It’s for analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by <em>producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms</em>. LSA assumes that <em>words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text</em>. A matrix containing word counts per document (rows represent unique words and columns represent each document). Documents are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (or the dot product between the normalizations of the two vectors) formed by any two columns. Values close to 1 represent very similar documents while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than using a window to define local context, <em>GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using statistics across the whole text corpus.</em></p>
<p>GloVe performs well at word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition tasks.</p>

<p>后面几天花了一天写中华乐教导引的作业，我选的题目是中华乐教在当代的弘扬路径，一不小心写出了一篇习概课文的感觉，果然是多年不写文章、写作能力退化到小学水平。希望以后能抽空多写写博文，练练手也是好的。</p>
<p>考虑到美国受疫情的影响，我开始考虑起保研的事情。之前想着去美国，其实是有保障的。如果读master,那毕业之后可以高薪工作、也可以继续申请phd。如果读phd，五年读出来又有科研实力又有一堆文章和人脉，不论是工作还是回国拿教职都是极好的。但疫情影响美国经济，这样一来读完master可能找不到工作、需要回国996，那何必出国读两年而不留在国内读呢？ Phd的话预计明年会很难申请，如果老师没有funding不招学生，那就没有phd可读。国内保研的话，人多坑少，竞争那叫一个惨烈。抱着买彩票的心态报名了几个夏令营，感谢愿意为我推荐的超级无敌好的文老师和黄老师~</p>
<p>偶尔还是会怀念达特茅斯的蓝天、Teyen老板家门口的Connecticut River、轻轻飘落雪花的Hanover小镇。更怀念在实验室废寝忘食又快乐的干活的自己哈哈哈</p>
<p>关于读研的去向问题，最近问了不少人。参加工作有参加工作的乐趣，也没有想象中的007式的辛苦，工资也比我形象中的高很多；国内读研也有国内的好处，如果跟的是本校最厉害的老师，那硕士期间也会过得很好，老师会支持你的想法，给予很大的帮助；但如果去外校读研，将面临导师很水的风险，本校本科生一直以来都是该校硕士的最好生源，好的老师的名额基本上都会分配给本校的学生，外校学生进去本身就很困难、进去之后能跟一个好的老师就更困难，我认为国内去外校保研是一场赌博，不太想冒这个险。国内只报清北的夏令营，能不能去都随缘；暑假的主要精力还是放在出国的准备方面：做暑研；考语言。最后大概率会是老老实实出国~</p>
<p>虽然疫情的到来导致情况非常复杂，计划赶不上变化，但我也乐于接受变幻莫测的未知的未来、变化未尝不是好事呢？</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="各篇文章的概述"><a href="#各篇文章的概述" class="headerlink" title="各篇文章的概述"></a>各篇文章的概述</h2><h3 id="Large-scale-Analysis-of-Counseling-Conversations-An-Application-of-Natural-Language-Processing-to-Mental-Health"><a href="#Large-scale-Analysis-of-Counseling-Conversations-An-Application-of-Natural-Language-Processing-to-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health"></a>Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health</h3><p>自然语言处理在心理健康领域的一个应用：分析大规模的咨询对话。</p>
<p><strong>研究的出发点：</strong></p>
<p>由于过去缺乏大规模的带有标记了的结果的对话数据，我们一直都没搞清楚应该如何引导成功的咨询对话。</p>
<p><strong>我们的努力</strong></p>
<p>我们在以文字为沟通方式的对话数据上，做了大规模的量化的研究。通过计算机来衡量语言学方面是如何影响到对话结果的。</p>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>是目前为止的最大规模的咨询对话策略方面的研究</li>
<li>特别的，我们注重分析咨询师，而不是分析病人。因为我们感兴趣的是通用的对话策略研究、而不是具体某一个话题。</li>
<li>我们找到了切实可行的对话策略：: Adaptability; Dealing with ambiguity; Creativity; Making progress; Change in perspective.</li>
<li>我们证明了对话的结果是可以通过我们发现的那些策略特征来预测的。</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>评价</strong></p>
<p>我挺喜欢这篇文章的，希望我们也可以做出类似的东西。感觉行文非常自然，顺畅。</p>
<h3 id="The-Channel-Matters-Self-disclosure-Reciprocity-and-Social-Support-in-Online-Cancer-Support-Groups"><a href="#The-Channel-Matters-Self-disclosure-Reciprocity-and-Social-Support-in-Online-Cancer-Support-Groups" class="headerlink" title="The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure, Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups"></a>The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure, Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups</h3><p>channel影响了在线癌症支持小组中人们发朋友圈吐槽和为他人提供支持鼓励的方式</p>
<p><strong>研究的出发点</strong> </p>
<p>我们想知道 之前的对于 人们在通用网站（facebook)上面使用不同的channel进行自我表露（发朋友圈）的方式的 的研究是不是适用于在线健康支持小组中。</p>
<p><strong>我们检测了这些方面</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>在在线癌症支持小组中，人们使用公开的channel和私密的channel发朋友圈的不同方式。</li>
<li>channel是如何平衡好发朋友圈吐槽和提供支持帮助这两个方面的。</li>

<p><strong>研究的出发点</strong></p>
<p>我们好奇：同伴间的支持（peer support）中的哪些因素造成了有效的社交对话效果？</p>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p>
<p>我们使用个例对照法（case-control)来研究是什么因素导致了有效的支持。<br>个例对照法来自于流行病学，它的好处是：不像正因果推论法（ forward causal inference methods）需要把变量二进制化，我们保留原值。这个方法对于①结果是明确定义的②因素是连续变量的分析是很有效的。<br>我们的方法不仅可以同时研究多个因素的影响，还可以研究单个因素在多大程度上有影响。</p>

<p><strong>研究的出发点</strong></p>
<p>在线的聊天中，大家可能聊着聊着就发生了冲突、争吵、攻击对方。最近别人的研究主要在检测单句话中的引起社交冲突(antisocial bahavior)，在聊天结束之后才来分析。我们想要在对话中出现冲突之前及时预测到即将出现冲突。<br>要实现预测有几个难题：</p>
<ol>
<li>对话是动态的，产生什么结果是取决于后续双方的交流。之前的解决方式是：主要依赖于手工制作的feature来找到冲突。也有人用neural attention的方式来解决。</li>
<li>对话的长度不定，需要预测的可能出现的冲突可能随时出现。之前的工作是：①预测发生冲突的时间，在那个时间到的时候来检查；②从固定大小的窗口中抽取特征。（吐槽点：window-size?)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>一个模型：可以在对话发生的过程中实现预测。</li>
<li>通过实时分析各个语句以及他们的关系，克服了那几个难题。</li>
<li><strong><em>在对话预测领域第一个使用pre-train-then-fine-tune方法的。</em></strong></li>

<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p>
<p>我们从癌症互助社区中，以用户的行为模式为依据，建了11个特定功能的角色模式。<br>我们还研究了角色的动态变化，包括：在用户使用这个社区期间，用户的角色是如何改变的？ 如何根据角色来预测用户是否会长期参与到这个社区中？<br>我们发现，用户频繁的改变自己的角色，从求助者到提供帮助者。整个社区的角色分布还是稳定的。<br>早期就形成特定角色的人在社区中参与时间会更长。</p>

<p><strong>研究的出发点</strong><br>越来越多的人开始在社交媒体网站上倾诉自己的不开心。我们想知道：</p>
<ol>
<li>在发朋友圈前后，行为有什么变化？</li>
<li>这些行为变化中，包括利于治疗的”opening up”吗？</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>用量化的方式来找到disclosure前后的时间阶段。</li>
<li>用一系列语言学的指标来描述disclosure前后的行为变化</li>
<li>我们找到了disclosure之后产生疗效的因素：improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions</li>

<ol>
<li>使用来自public sources 的noisy的咨询数据，来分析咨询质量。（实用，点赞👍）</li>
<li>通过分析对话的各个方面（ turn-by-turn interaction, the sentiment expressed during the interaction, linguistic alignment, and salient topics)，从而找到了高质量咨询的模式。</li>

<p><strong>我们的努力</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>定义了“a moment of change”.对于一个患者曾经表示负面情绪的话题，只要患者表达了积极的情绪，那我们就称之为”a moment of change”</li>
<li>提出了一个模型，可以预测一个对话或者一个朋友圈（post)中是否有发生“a moment of change”</li>
<li>我们提出的SentiTopic模型可以显式的追踪每个post中的话题和情感。据此我们知道重塑认知是如何发生的。</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1603802406/IMG_8199_20200529-225733_snjrcl.jpg" alt=""><br>在广州隔离了十四天后，回到家里又被社区要求自觉居家隔离十四天，于是整个五月和六月初几乎都在隔离中度过了。现在回想起来，在广州隔离的那段日子还是非常的舒服的：热情的工作人员跑上跑下的给大家送外卖，温柔的护士小姐姐小哥哥每天上门查两次体温，隔离结束的时候隔离酒店还给每个人送了“福”的红底毛笔字留作纪念。在此再次感谢广州番禺区的宜必思酒店！</p>
<h3 id="六月·暑研"><a href="#六月·暑研" class="headerlink" title="六月·暑研"></a>六月·暑研</h3><p>这是一段难忘又难受的经历，大概就是跟着美国某著名高校的raising star一样的一个AP，然后八字不合闹的不欢而散的事情，在此略去一万个字。</p>
<h3 id="七月·保研"><a href="#七月·保研" class="headerlink" title="七月·保研"></a>七月·保研</h3><p>看着国际形势越来越恶化，以及父母的担心，我选择了保研。海投了一波学校：清华北大复旦上交中科大中科院港中文。中奖了港中文、中科大、中科院和清华。当时香港还没出国安法，担心局势不稳定就没去。清华的夏令营在中科大和中科院的前面，清华面试完之后自我感觉良好，所以就没有继续参加后面的两个学校的活动了。</p>
<p>虽然后面的录取过程非常的曲折，让我一度非常后悔当初为什么没多拿几个学校的offer。今年由于疫情的影响，教育部分发研究生名额的日期推迟了几乎一个月，因此我们学校的保研资格证明也迟迟没有发放，但是清华大学依旧催着要求我们出具保研资格证明或者强有力的辅助材料，由于本人实在是菜，以上三个机构的时间安排冲突给我造成了很大的麻烦，再次感谢帮助我的各位老师和给我舒缓压力的各位朋友。</p>
<h3 id="八月·手术"><a href="#八月·手术" class="headerlink" title="八月·手术"></a>八月·手术</h3><p>动了个小手术，住院了几天。 有了实习的念头，在educative上刷了一些算法题。刷的是grokking the coding interview的题目，我很喜欢这个课程，深入浅出，把算法题的套路分为几大类型，每个类型都先从简单的例子开始讲思想，然后再慢慢举一反三，给人一种无痛刷题的美好体验。<br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1603803523/%E6%8D%95%E8%8E%B7_nzyop8.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="九月·重返校园"><a href="#九月·重返校园" class="headerlink" title="九月·重返校园"></a>九月·重返校园</h3><p>年初一月离开武汉去美国的时候，武汉海鲜市场就已经爆出新闻说有不明传染病了，因此我还在宿舍买了两大包的口罩，虽然我也懒得戴，疫情期间送给宿管阿姨了。刚到美国不久武汉就封城了，再次回到校园已经是九月，这是我没有预料到的。</p>
<p>九月主要在折腾保研手续的事情，这个过程极其痛苦，好在最后顺利的保了研。九月还过了一次回想起来还是非常开心的生日。<br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1603803753/DF753D32318538769EEE485E29DFAAEF_ar1zra.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="十月·实习"><a href="#十月·实习" class="headerlink" title="十月·实习"></a>十月·实习</h3><p>投了三家公司，去了回复最快的那一家（对，就是Intel)。还有一家愿意要我的组是做游戏的，不太感兴趣就没去。还有一家回复的实在太慢，十月中旬才打电话来笔试(╬▔皿▔)凸</p>
<p>十月十四号，终于尘埃落地收到了清华大学的预录取通知。说不上多么开心，也说不上多么难受。不是很开心是因为原计划出国读书，恰好年初在Dartmouth度过了愉快的四个月，去完一趟美国之后更加憧憬在那里度过一段学习的时光了，最后没能去成，有一种曾经沧海难为水的感觉。但也不是很难受，研究生的导师出了名的好，师兄师姐也很热情，上周旁听了一次组会，组里氛围也很棒。那就随遇而安吧(<em>^_^</em>)<br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1603804400/IMG_1058_20201027-211306_vsrzgg.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>十月二十二日，UIST会议在线上召开，寒研的论文终于发表出来啦！回想那段时光，又辛苦又开心。</p>
<p>9.28开始在上海intel实习。组里做quantize aware training的，来之前我对这个领域一无所知，只知道是机器学习优化、面试的时候觉得这个工作挺有意思的就来了。来之后日常懵逼，疯狂补概念。最近几天会再写一篇博文谈谈自己对quantize aware training的理解。实习遇到的人都很好，虽然他们不太会表达但是时间久了还是可以感受到大家满满的善意❤。感觉自己又菜又牛。目前仍然在适应实习的环境中，每天问自己无数次：“我是谁？我在哪？我要做什么？”。但还是时常感到茫然，开始怀疑人生：我是不是不适合做这种工作？我大学期间是不是过的太顺利了没遇到过一点挫折，才导致现在遇到挑战之后非常难受？有时候也会上升到开始思考人生的意义( ﹁ ﹁ ) ~→可能是我书读的太少，对于社会和心理的认知不够，才会陷入这样的迷茫吧。买了一些书，还是要多读书，尽量不要让自己陷在“书读的太少而想得太多”的困境中。</p>
<p>在上海租的小房子经过我一个月以来的收拾，变得非常的温馨啦。阳光洒进来，满屋子都是温暖的味道。<br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmfrqkuif/image/upload/v1603805430/E911F452FC56363BAD7FC64E944D825F_dfdzzj.jpg" alt=""></p>
